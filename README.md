For this assignment you want to create a new child duck class. _This can be a real type of duck (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatidae) for a comprehensive list, which includes Geese and Swans), or you can make one up on your own, e.g., DecoyDuck.java, PirateDuck.java, etc._ 

For this assignment, you will need to:

1. First accept the invitation to join this ducks repository (check your notifications on githhub.com, or check your email) 
2. Clone the repository locally to your computer 
3. Create a new branch for the new feature you will add (i.e. adding a new kind
   of duck) with **git branch**, **git checkout**
4. Make the necessary additions to the code (i.e. create your new duck class)
5. Add and commit your changes, then push them to the repository (using **git add**, **git commit**, and **git push**)
6. Create a pull request (and leave it open for it to be reviewed)
